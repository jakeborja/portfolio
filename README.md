# Hey this is My Portfolio/Blog thing.
This is where I want to document all the projects I do. Especially in Project Smart Bus. Come back and see some other projects I have in mind!

## Project Smart Bus
This is a a project that I took on about 7 months ago. The point of this Project was to Back as many Projects into an off grid 40ft School Bus turned tiny house. It's For sure a labor of love and not as practical as i anticipated but alas here we are. 

This isnt a "Build a Skoolie Guide." I am  **N O W H E R E   N E A R**  an authority on the subject. iinfact if anyone tells you they are... well they're a ***liar.***

First I'll Document the "major hardware." Then I'll go into how they work together and some of the probelems I've found. Last I'll tell you about some super fun projects i'd LIKE to implement as time comes.

### Currently **Project Smart Bus** runs:
- a Linovo Thinkcenter mini pc running [Proxmox](https://proxmox.com/en/)
- A [Chester Tech Repair 5g Router](https://chestertechrepairs.com/products/5g-cheetah-v2-%F0%9F%90%86-dual-sim-wi-fi-6-industrial-lte-nr5g-wireless-modem-router-bundle-fixed-wireless-access-point-can-work-mobile)
- A [Waveform 4x4 antenna](https://www.waveform.com/products/quadmini)
- a Rasperberry Pi 5 8gb

- more smart products than I'd like to admit.
